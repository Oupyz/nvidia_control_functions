# nvidia_control_functions
# this is a script to ease the control over  nvidia functions on linux , but it does run on windows and mac , it's the first version 0.1 , will continue to improve 
# over time as i'am thinking of to add a small gui and  maybe later find a way to control nvidia functions  over wayland without needing sudo or root permission .
